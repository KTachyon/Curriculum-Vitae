Curriculum Vitæ
==========
My curriculum vitae typesetted in LaTeX based on the Europass model

About
----------

This repository will always maintain the latest version of my curriculum vitae typesetted in the lovely Calibri font by [Lucas de Groot](http://www.lucasfonts.com/). Although I've based my CV on the Europass model - cause that's what most employers require around here - I've tweaked it quite a bit to improve the overall look and feel and make it more to my liking.

It uses the XeTeX engine with the 'fontspec' package for better font rendering and support for modern fonts such as Calibri.
